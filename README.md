INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROJECT:

On the HTML side, I put my name and the navigation link on the Header using the h1 and ul elements. Under the li I added an href to point to the "About Me" section and "Work" section.

Next is the main section where in my picture image is included.

The next section is the About Me section wherein I created a div element and used aside element to transform and adjust the location later to right. Underneath is is the information about me and I used p element as a paragraph.

The next section is the Work Section wherein I used Div parent element under the name box2. All the headings of the past experiences I created a class called work on an "a" element.

The next section is the Contact section wherein a I used a Div parent called box3. It has a child section called contact to group all my my contact informations such as my email, github, twitter and the spotify.

On the CSS sytle. I created a header and define the properties. Then I set the properties of my name Harold Gonzales. Then I flex my nav area into one line using the follwing command

display:flex and flex-warp:wrap

I set the properties of my nav li, a, and ul.

Then I created a Hover command to change the color of the name when mouse clicked.

The next command is my picture properties under the .sample-img.

I set the margins of my h2 and h3 which is the "About me", "Work" and the Work sub headers and the Contact.

I set the properties of my Paragraph.

Using the flex command, I wrap the list of works (experiences) into one line.

Then I set the propertioes of the word "About ME", "Work" and the Contact" into the right location.

I configure the main properties of the Work section and flex and arrange the item.

I created a hover for the list of work experiences so when the mouse point to it, it will change the background color.

I used the PSEUDO command first-child to make the property of the 1st work experience to become bigger that the rest.

and lastly, I arrange the properties of my Contact lsit to move to the right.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the way to design this project is based from the given requirements I started to write down all the information needed and begin to start arranging them in such a way you could easily manipulate the parent and the child elements and structure them in such a way that you can call them directly on your css and apply the style.

This is very challenging because it will help you to analyze and research properly in order to build this project.
